It certainly has battery issues. What's the use of such beautiful display and other features when you can't use it because of such poor battery. Camera is not as per my expectations. RAM is consumed at least 50% without any app running. It cannot recognise your face to unlock in dark areas unlike other smart phone coming at 25% of its cost.

NOT HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. AND THE WORST PART CANT RETURN IT. THIS IS CHEATING. FIRST THEY SAY PHONE WILL LAST WHOLE DAY BUT ACTUALLY IT LAST ONLY 4-6HRS ON TYPICAL USAGE WITHOUT ANY GAMES.

MY VIVO V11 pro was much better than this.

This phone is the eye candy for all class..excellent camera..light weight,super fast processor, loaded with 8GB ram and 256 GB internal memory (lowest version),butter smooth touch,6.3 inch full oled display,good battery backup, a premium earphone set and above of all addition of S pen with air magic..I loved this phone..worth of each penny.
Thanks Amazon prime for quick and safe delivery.

Delivered on Aug 25 It's been 50 Days with this device, initially I worried about the battery drain issue, though it's common in new devices. It took 5 days to get the actual battery life. I am getting 12-15 hours on a typical day usage. Camera is Awesome. All we need to talk about is S Pen which makes this most perfect flagship phone in the market. This is my First Samsung Device. Like the most Samsung Apps including Samsung Tutor that assisted me in resolving the issues quickly. Thought of Buying Note 9 but waited but bought Note 10. It met my expectations. My Suggestions to new buyers if you are a pro user then go for it. Don't forget to get Samsung Buds and Watch to get connected.

This is the best phone for all those who want to pay a premium and get their money's worth!

The display is probably the best in smartphones today. Some would say that the refresh rate isn't great but to most users it doesn't matter.

The camera is great especially in low light conditions. The battery lasts all day long and this is from a very heavy social media user.

The stylus makes this phone a cut above the rest.

I have been an iPhone user for 9 years and I'll tell you what , Samsung has a winner!

This tempted me to make the switch and I am proud to say I own a Samsung Note 10 today.

Samsung has achieved really great with this product, it has amazing build quality and it feels really comfortable while holding it.

Camera quality and screen has done its great job to amaze me.

You get a nice transparent silicom cover in box with this amazing phone.

Dolby Atmos sound effect makes it louder and clear music.

The S-Pen is a cherry on top.
